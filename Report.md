## Questions

1. Why does your program need a setup and a loop?

    set up is needed to initialize the program and variables and loop has the codes that the program runs forever unless the program is stopped

2. What is the downside to putting all your code in a loop?

   Putting all the code in a loop will mostly likely make it difficult to debug if problems pop up

3. Why does your code need to be compiled?

    the code is compiled so that the computer can understand the language and run the program

4. When lowering the frequency in procedure A, step 4, what is going wrong? Brainstorm some solutions. Dimmers exist in the real world. What is their solution?

    the LED starts to flick constantly when the frequency is lowered
